-- This schema is for the local SQLite file. Note that SQLite's behavior is
-- meaningfully different from Postgres's. In particular, it is weakly typed by
-- default, supports fewer datatypes[^1], and foreign keys must be opted-in via
-- application pragma.
--
-- This schema file is kept up-to-date manually. It should be updated whenever a
-- new migration is created.
--
-- TODO: Automatically check and update this schema file from migrations in CI.
