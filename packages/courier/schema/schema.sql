-- Schema file for Courier.
-- This file is maintained by hand; we use `sql-schema` to generate migrations.
--
-- After making changes to this file, run `sql-schema` to generate a migration
-- within the root of the `courier` package:
-- ```
-- sql-schema migration --name {new name here}
-- ```

-- Empty schema for now. Tables will be added when we implement distributed caching.
